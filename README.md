If you request your “Twitter archive” from Twitter, you can use this tool to get lists of all your:

* mutuals (people you follow who follow you back)
* non-mutual followers who you've replied to at least once
* non-mutual followers who you've never replied to

The lists are generated as HTML files with clickable links. They're sorted by reply count (descending).

The follower list data included in a Twitter archive doesn't include usernames, but this script is able to recover them from the tweet data in the archive! However, that only works when you've replied to a follower at least once. Similarly only replies from you (not from them) are counted, simply because Twitter archives only contain data on your own tweets.

I wrote this tool to help me reduce my Twitter follower count.

You need PHP 7 or later to use it.
