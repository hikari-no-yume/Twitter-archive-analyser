If you request your “Twitter archive” from Twitter, you can use this tool to get lists of all your:

* mutuals (people you follow who follow you back)
* non-mutual followers who you've replied to at least once
* non-mutual followers who you've never replied to

The lists are generated as HTML files with clickable links. They're sorted by reply count (descending).

The missing usernames and the fact only replies from you (not from them) are counted are due to the limited data a Twitter archive provides.

I wrote this tool to help me reduce my Twitter follower count.

You need PHP 7 or later to use it.
